Notes:

> Dont need to specify USL type in model class instance, can just do encode,___ for SimCLR and use both for AE
> Now every time ae_train is run, need a new configuration to be passed in if want to change alpha or denoising architecture
> Embedding is required to run model with runepoch function, so if no embedding, output tuple with blank first entry


To do:
> Add picture saving to ColabExport
> Make sure alphas are working
> Run experiments

Wishlist:
> In printing function, pass in config and then distinguish depending on what type of ssl is being completed
> Have representation dim be calculated from the previous layer instead of needing to be passed in
> Collect and examine at batch-wise losses

Hyperparameters:
> AE's
    > Alpha
    > Latent "bottleneck" dimension
    > Learning Rate
