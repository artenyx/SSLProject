-> BT paper crop + resize, color jitter, hor flip, grayscale, gaus blur, solarization

To Do:
> Implement k-NN
> Change layerwise to have projection head
> Code plotting function to take in multiple experiment files


Ideas:
> Code and compare SimSiam as another non-contrastive method
> Recreate BYOL plot with removing transforms
> See how it works as a generative model (VQ-VAE, VAE)
> SimCLR -> try maximizing agreement of each branch with original
